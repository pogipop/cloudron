# Cloudron

[Cloudron](https://cloudron.io) is the best way to run apps on your server.

Web applications like email, contacts, blog, chat are the backbone of the modern
internet. Yet, we live in a world where hosting these essential applications is
a complex task.

We are building the ultimate platform for self-hosting web apps. The Cloudron allows
anyone to effortlessly host web applications on their server on their own terms.

## Features

* Per-app encrypted backups and restores.

* App updates delivered via the App Store.

* Secure - Cloudron manages the firewall. All apps are secured with HTTPS. Certificates are
  installed and renewed automatically.

* Centralized User & Group management. Control who can access which app.

* Single Sign On. Use same credentials across all apps.

* Trivially migrate to another server keeping your apps and data (for example, switch your
  infrastructure provider or move to a bigger server).
