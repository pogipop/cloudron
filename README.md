# Cloudron

[Cloudron](https://cloudron.io) is the best way to run apps on your server.

Web applications like email, contacts, blog, chat are the backbone of the modern
internet. Yet, we live in a world where hosting these essential applications is
a complex task.

We are building the ultimate platform for self-hosting web apps. The Cloudron allows
anyone to effortlessly host web applications on their server on their own terms.
