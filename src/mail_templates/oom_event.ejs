Dear <%= cloudronName %> Admin,

<%= program %>  exited unexpectedly using too much memory!

The app has been restarted now. Should this message appear repeatedly or
undefined behavior is observed, give the app more memory.
This can be done in the advanced settings in the app configuration dialog
in your Cloudron's web interface.

Please see some excerpt of the logs below.
