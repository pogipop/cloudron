Dear Cloudron Admin,

The application '<%= title %>' installed at <%= appFqdn %> is not responding.

This is most likely a problem in the application.

To resolve this, you can try the following:
* Restart the app by opening the app's web terminal - https://cloudron.io/documentation/apps/#web-terminal
* Restore the app to the latest backup - https://cloudron.io/documentation/backups/#restoring-an-app
* Contact us via support@cloudron.io or https://forum.cloudron.io
